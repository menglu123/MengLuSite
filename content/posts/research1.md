- **Natural Language Processing：**
  - Propose the novel adversarial attack method FastAttacker, study and design the details of the algorithm.
  - Pre-train BERT model with FEVER datasets
  - Attack BERT model and SOTA Adversarial Attack model—KernelGAT with our framework using FEVER test datasets.
  - Attack target BERT and KernelGAT model compared with two other baselines—TextFooler and BERTAttack.
  - Build models and create adversarial text attacks
  - Doing experiments on algorithms
  - Drafted and edited academic paper content
- **Recommender system：**
  - Employ task-oriented optimization procedure and generate personalized bridge function with meta-network. Experiment with a novel framework named Personalized Transfer of User Preferences for Cross-domain Recommendation transfer user preference from an auxiliary domain to a target domain.
  - Study and capture users’ dynamic interest utilizing Deep reinforcement learning and experiment on novel state-aware experiment replay mode, which recommends the agent with the optimal policy for the online recommendation. Employ locality-sensitive hashing to map high-dimensional data into low-dimensional representations and a prioritized reward-driven strategy to replay more valuable experiences at a higher chance.
  - Improved the recommendation algorithm of seq2seq, adding autoattent on the original basis, which allows the algorithm to automatically modify the parameters of the attention mechanism
  - Processed collected data, found baseline through literature review, and improved accuracy by comparing proposed algorithm with the same dataset
  - Drafted and edited academic paper content
- **Cooperate with other research groups:**
  - Pennsylvania State University
    - Prepared data in support of developing an innovative compaction monitoring method
    - Employed machine learning model to predict the compaction condition of Superpave gyratory compactor (SGC) specimens
    - Improved fine-grained algorithms to achieve better classification outcomes of newly added datasets
    - Predicted the outcome label of which material to use under various circumstances
  - Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai
    - Contributed to building an automated radiomics analysis system by combining thyroid segmentation via U-Net and radiomics feature extraction
    - Gathered ultrasound image data from large-scale hospitals; used computer vision work on images to transfer them to 2-D arrays; built and trained CNN models with input of 2-D arrays
    - Tested the model and conducted deep learning classification to predict malignancy of thyroid nodule
