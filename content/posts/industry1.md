- *Improved original Excel model for quantifying financial data and reports*
  - Added VBA macro keys on the basis of the original Excel operation and implemented the function of keys through VBA programming
  - Increased the ability to add data, add and delete rows and columns, and find data through buttons, including calling out different ratios of financial indicators generated under different conditions
  - Developed modeling software as the only member of the team with a CS background
  - Tools used: **VBA, Python,C/C++**
- *Database construction*
  - Created a backend database for the whole department using SQL; classified, merged, summarized, and searched different financial companies under different sections
  - Classified by rating the companies â€˜performance into 21 credit levels, and analyzed by extracting the financial report information according to the degree of use of the model in the four main financial models
