- Used unsupervised learning techniques to train a model for cross-section returns analysis, and adopted **Latent Dirichlet Allocation** model to verify the correctness of the trained model
- Trained models with supervised learning algorithms -- **Decision Trees, SVM, and Neural Networks** -- to predict empirical cross-section asset pricing and returns, and provide support for stock selection and investment
- Applied Natural Language Processing to extract important risk factors from companiesâ€™ MD&A disclosures and trained supervised learning model (generalized linear model) to quantify them
- Constructed 3-factor and 5-factor Fama-French models that help to explain average returns on stocks
